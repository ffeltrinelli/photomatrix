# Overview

Simple command-line application which concatenates a list of photos into a single photo
showing them in a matrix (in other words, a grid). 

# Installation

First of all, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7 or greater installed in your system.

Then, as `photomatrix` is a command line application, open a terminal and be ready to type commands.

## Install automatically with pip

`photomatrix` is available from the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/)), so installable
with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

```
pip3 install photomatrix
```

You should now have `photomatrix` available in your shell. For example, print the command help:

```
photomatrix -h
```

## Build locally

Alternatively, you can build locally from source code. First, clone this project from Github.

Cd into the root folder.

Create a virtual environment (e.g. named `my_env`) and activate it:

```
python3 -m venv my_venv
source my_venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dev dependencies and the app dependencies into the virtual environment:

```
pip3 install -r requirements_dev.txt
pip3 install -e .
```

Run like this:

```
python3 -m photomatrix -h
```

# Usage

The basic usage is:

```
photomatrix INPUT_IMAGES OUTPUT_IMAGE
```

where all the images found in the specified input path will be loaded, sorted, combined in a matrix
and the result will be written in the specified output path.  

Further options that you can customize are:
* Number of rows vs columns
* Resize and crop
* Sorting
* Border
* Text to print (e.g. filename or Exif original date)

See the command help (with `-h`) for more info on these options.

# Examples

The following examples use these test input images:

<img src="data/input/01.jpg?raw=true" width="150">

up to

<img src="data/input/12.jpg?raw=true" width="150">

## Matrix with border

To build a matrix with a simple border:

```
photomatrix "data/input/*.jpg" data/output/matrix_border.jpg --border-width-ratio 0.1
```

resulting in:

<img src="data/output/matrix_border.jpg?raw=true" width="600">

## Matrix sorted and with text

To build a matrix with inverse filename order, printing the filename in top center position:

```
photomatrix "data/input/*.jpg" data/output/matrix_sort_text.jpg --sort filename_desc --text-type filename --text-position top_center
```

resulting in:

<img src="data/output/matrix_sort_text.jpg?raw=true" width="600">

# Integration Tests

Run the integration tests with:

```
python3 -m pytest tests/integration
```
